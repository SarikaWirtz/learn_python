# Working with Loops


        
# Writing pseudocode
# Before you run the Python script, write out the logic of the while loop in written (non-code) sentences. This technique is called pseudocoding.

# For example:

# If the user has not guessed the correct answer, enter the loop.

# Ask the user for a guess.

# Is the guess the correct number?

# If the correct guess, tell the user it was the correct guess and exit the loop.

# If the wrong guess, tell the user it was the wrong guess and continue the loop.

print("Welcome to Guess the Number!")
print("The rules are simple. I will think of a number, and you will try to guess it.")

import random

number = random.randint(1,10)

print(f'this is rendom number {number}')
# print('this is rendom number {}'.format(number))

isGuessRight = False

while isGuessRight != True:
    guess = input("Guess a number between 1 and 10: ")
    if int(guess) == number:
        print("You guessed {}. That is correct! You win!".format(guess))
        isGuessRight = True
    else:
        print("You guessed {}. Sorry, that isnâ€™t it. Try again.".format(guess))
